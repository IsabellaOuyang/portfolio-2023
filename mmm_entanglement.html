            Entanglement in quantum physics means when a group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity, the state of each particle cannot be independent of  others, even when they are separated by distances. Through this film, I want to address the similarities and differences among all. The scale can be national, regional, and individual.
            <br>
            With the concept of entanglement, I started and ended with the visuals of parallel universes to point out the similarities among us that each is just a small particle in the universe. In this film, there are three examples that I try to use to address the differences. The examples mainly talk about the difference in asian and western culture but it implies  the differences of each individual.
            <br>
            The first one is the differences in tableware. In 2018, Dolce & Gabbana released a controversial ad that shows how Chinese use chopsticks to eat italian food such as pizzas, spaghetti, and so on in a funny way. The conflict was caused by their unintentional disrespect towards a different food culture and also the misunderstanding of humor in another culture.
            In the film, the right side is the D&G campaign with an English voiceover and the left is a parody of the campaign created by a content creator. He acts as a westerner who tries to eat Chinese food with forks and knives.
            <br>
            Second is the different concepts of food- what can be eaten or not. Some have stereotypes that all Chinese and Korean eat dog meat and judge everyone who eats it; however, it is an obsolete tradition that happens in some regions only. The fact is that every culture may have a taboo in terms of what can be eaten or not. So, maybe it is hypercritical to judge one another without understanding the background.
            In the film, I overlay the 2016 London protest against Yulin (dog meat) festival and footage of cute moments humans have with dogs. On the other side are footage of people who trade and eat dog meat in Yulin. After this, there are two parallel interviews showing how Asians hold different attitudes towards dog eating. I wanna show that difference does not only occur among different cultures but more among individuals. Behind the interviews, I overlayed the movie Okja, which is about a girl who raises a genetically modified superpig. She saved Okja from being slaughtered by paying a golden pig.
            <br>
            Third is the different values of women’s bodies. Asian women tend to value double eyelids, whitening, and photoshopping their pictures a lot. American women tend to value lips, hips, and breasts more. Also, it points out the differences of gender- how women are judged by their physical appearance a lot.
            In the film, I put some footage of some viral challenges about bodies in China. The A4 challenge - use an A4 paper to compare how thin your waist is. The coin challenge- put coins on collarbones. Belly Button challenge - twist your arm to reach your belly button backwards. The wrist challenge- wrap the bills on your wrist. There is also a controversial ad about plastic surgery. It basically says women should get plastic surgery to be pretty. The eyeballs are showing how society demands women to be one way or another and how people also are affected by other people’s opinions. On the other side, is a short film Supervenus that animates how western women want their bodies to be like.
            <br>
            The topics of differences contain genders, beauty standards, food culture, race, values and so on.  Along the path of migration, there are a lot of collisions of different values and cultures, the stereotypes and misunderstanding may make you repulse a different culture. So, it is important for people to realize the differences and embrace them because every individual is unique but living in the same universe.
            That’s why I started and ended with a series of questions which lead the audience into the topic and finish with the same questions but with different thoughts hopefully.
